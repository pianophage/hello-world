# hello-world
Hello, GitHub!
My name is Jesse, and I love very low-level, bare-metal programming. I am currently interested in the RISC-V project, and I'm trying to find ways to contribute on the software side. I am quickly learning just how difficult it is to work with a technology that is still very early in development.
