# Markdown Scratchpad

This is my little scratchpad for learning Markdown. It will probably be pretty incoherent to you.

The above line forms a paragraph, and so does this one.

This one, too!

## A subheading
### A subsubheading
#### A subsubsubheading
##### A subsubsubsubheading
###### I don't think we can go any further than this...
####### Or can we? (Ah, no, no we can't.)

A blockquote...

> ...is done with greentext?

*Some nice italic text*

**SOME URGENT BOLD TEXT**

*Some nice italic text _AND THEN SOME URGENT BOLD TEXT_*

**SOME URGENT BOLD TEXT _and then some nice italic text_**
